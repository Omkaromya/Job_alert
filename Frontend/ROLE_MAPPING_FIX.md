# ✅ Role Mapping Issue Fixed

## 🔍 Problem Identified
The "Access denied. Your account role does not match the required role" error was caused by **role mapping inconsistency**:

- **Frontend UI**: Uses `candidate`, `employer`, `admin`
- **Backend API**: Uses `user`, `employer`, `admin`
- **Registration**: Maps `candidate` → `user` ✅
- **Login**: Was comparing roles directly without mapping ❌

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

### 1. **Added Role Mapping Functions**
```javascript
// Map UI role to API role (for registration)
const mapUiRoleToApi = (role) => (role === 'candidate' ? 'user' : role);

// Map API role to UI role (for login comparison)
const mapApiRoleToUi = (role) => (role === 'user' ? 'candidate' : role);
```

### 2. **Fixed Login Role Comparison**
```javascript
// Before (❌ Wrong)
if (backendRole !== role) {
  showToast('error', `Access denied. Your account role does not match the required role.`);
}

// After (✅ Fixed)
const mappedBackendRole = mapApiRoleToUi(backendRole);
if (mappedBackendRole !== role) {
  showToast('error', `Access denied. Your account role (${mappedBackendRole}) does not match the required role (${role}).`);
}
```

### 3. **Removed Duplicate Function**
- Removed duplicate `mapUiRoleToApi` function definition
- Now using single definition at the top of LoginPage component

## 🎯 Result

Now when a user:
1. **Registers as "candidate"** → Backend stores as "user" ✅
2. **Logs in as "candidate"** → Frontend maps backend "user" to "candidate" for comparison ✅
3. **Role comparison works correctly** → No more access denied errors ✅

## 🧪 Test It Now

Try logging in with:
- **Candidate role** → Should work for users registered as candidates
- **Employer role** → Should work for users registered as employers  
- **Admin role** → Should work for users registered as admins

The role mapping is now consistent throughout the application! 🚀
